I've recently made the leap from full time architect to data engineer. After a lifetime of tinkering with programming and technology, I've decided to make my passion my vocation. Having transitioned from a design & management career in construction into the technology sector, I bring unique perspectives to technical challenges and products including:

- Experience delivering extremely complex projects with interdisciplinary teams
- A hunger to work on fast moving software projects, with an eye for detail and quality
- Well honed communication and briefing skills, along with technical knowledge and a teacher's knack for explaining complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders
